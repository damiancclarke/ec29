LAPP is a platform that seeks to gather, organize and provide in a straightforward fashion, information (causal evidence) on the impacts of public policy and social programs that went under rigorous evaluation worldwide.

We have been trying to tranform academic papers of several pages into information accessible to everyone interested on the impact of public policies and social programs. Below you can find some of our policy briefs:

* [Pathways to Education (Toronto, Canada)](https://michelszklo.github.io/briefs/EDUC_CS_Pathways%20(en).pdf)
* [Jóvenes en Acción (Colombia)](https://michelszklo.github.io/briefs/LM&W_CS_JeA%20(en).pdf)
* [Vocational Training Programs, ISKUR (Turkey)](https://michelszklo.github.io/briefs/LM&W_CS_ISKUR%20(en).pdf)
* [“Programa de Fiscalização a Partir de Sorteios Públicos” (Brazil)](https://michelszklo.github.io/briefs/P&G_CS_CGU%20(en).pdf)
